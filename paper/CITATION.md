## Abstract

The paper demonstrates that tiny recursive models with as few as 2 layers can outperform much larger hierarchical networks when combined with deep recursion. Key findings include achieving 87.4% accuracy on Sudoku-Extreme with only 7M parameters compared to 55% for HRM with 27M parameters.
